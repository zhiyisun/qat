SLA manager overview
====================
sla_mgr tool is used to create, update, delete, list and get SLA capabilites
with a rate limiting feature v1 and v2 support.
Some commands vary between feature generations and are marked by RL_V1/RL_V2.

Enable RateLimiting Feature
===========================
RateLimiting feature is supported only in rate limiting firmware for
cryptographic services.
    * Install driver package in host with SRIOV enabled
    * Update physical function configuration file to set RateLimitingEnabled=1
      in [GENERAL] section
    * Set ServicesEnabled to cy or sym or asym
    * Perform qat_service shutdown and qat_service start

SLA manager commands
====================
SLA manager executable is available in $ICP_ROOT/build/sla_mgr after
the package is built and installed using ./configure; make install commands.

Below are the commands to manage SLAs

        *RL_V1*
        Create SLA - ./sla_mgr create <vf_addr> <rate_in_sla_units> <service>
        Update SLA - ./sla_mgr update <pf_addr> <sla_id> <rate_in_sla_units>

        *RL_V2*
        Create SLA - ./sla_mgr create <vf_addr> <cir> <pir> <service>
        Update SLA - ./sla_mgr update <pf_addr> <sla_id> <cir> <pir>

        Delete SLA - ./sla_mgr delete <pf_addr> <sla_id>
        Delete all SLAs - ./sla_mgr delete_all <pf_addr>
        Query SLA capabilities - ./sla_mgr caps <pf_addr>
        Query list of SLAs - ./sla_mgr list <pf_addr>

Options:
      pf_addr           Physical address in bus:device:function(xx:xx.x) format
      vf_addr           Virtual address in bus:device.function(xx:xx.x) format
      service           Asym(=0) or Sym(=1) cryptographic services and
                        *RL_V2*
                        Dc(=2) compression services
      rate_in_sla_units [0-MAX]. MAX is found by querying the capabilities
                        1 rate_in_sla_units is equal to:
                        1 operation per second - for asymmetric service
                        1 Megabits per second - for symmetric service
      cir/pir           [0-MAX]. MAX is found by querying the capabilities
                        committed/peak information rate
                        1 cir/pir unit is equal to:
                        0.1 percent of available utilisation - for asym service
                        1 Megabit per second - for sym/dc services
      sla_id            Value returned by create command

NOTES:
      1. An SLA is uniquely identified by <pf_addr, sla_id>
      2. For a given service, device would guarantee minimum rate_in_sla_units
         throughput. Maximum throughput can be upto maximum capacity of device.
