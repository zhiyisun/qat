/*
 * This is sample code that demonstrates usage of event notifications for
 * DC instances. The test flow as followed:
 * 1) the instances are created and notification callbacks are registered
 * 2) user issues adf_ctl reset
 * 3) the test code polls the device events until all the
 *    CPA_INSTANCE_EVENT_RESTARTED notifications are received.
 * Note: When reset is issued for QAT devices, before calling
 * icp_sal_userStop() wait for restarted events from all instances it has
 * access to from these QAT devices.
